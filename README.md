# Redshift Configuration

**A YAD based bash script that provides a GUI for the configuring Redshift.**

## Summary
Formally named Nightlight, but the project has grown beyond the standard configuring,
to truly setting up Redshift. An application used by many distributions that do not
have build-in blue light management.

Information about - [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) can be found - [here](http://jonls.dk/redshift/).

Though great as **Redshift** is, it does have some drawbacks. Most notably no GUI for
easy management, something that would be helpful for new comers to linux and are unaware
of the features **Redshift** offers.
